      <p>
        NativeApply rewrites text you submit — such as cover letters, resume bullet points, and messages to
        recruiters — using artificial intelligence, so it reads more naturally to a native English speaker. Without a
        paid plan, use is limited to one rewrite per browser per day, resetting at midnight UTC. Failed generations
        do not use this allowance. NativeApply Pro removes the daily limit. Each request supports up to 6,000 characters,
        including spaces and line breaks. Some symbols, such as emoji, count as more than one character in the editor.

        You retain all rights to the text you submit. We do not claim ownership over your content, and we do not use
        your submissions to train AI models. Do not submit content you don&apos;t have the right to share, or content
        that is unlawful, defamatory, or infringes on someone else&apos;s rights.

        NativeApply helps you write clearer, more natural English. It does not guarantee that you will get an
        interview, an offer, or any specific job-search outcome. AI can make mistakes or change the meaning of a
        sentence. Review every result before using it, especially names, dates, qualifications, and achievements.
        NativeApply does not make hiring decisions or verify your credentials.

        <p>NativeApply offers one paid plan: Pro at US$19 per month. If you subscribe, it renews automatically
          each month until cancelled. Checkout shows the currency, applicable taxes, and total before you pay.
          Any future price change will be communicated before it applies, with consent where required by law.</p>
        <p>Paddle is our Merchant of Record and authorised reseller. It handles payment processing, billing,
          taxes, and refunds. Purchases are also subject to the <a href="https://www.paddle.com/legal/buyer-terms">Paddle Buyer Terms</a>.</p>
        <p>You can <a href="/subscription#cancel">cancel on NativeApply</a> after verifying your purchase email.
          Confirm cancellation before the next renewal to stop future renewals. You normally keep Pro until the
          end of the paid billing period. Cancelling does not automatically request a refund. Every payment, including renewals,
          has a 14-day money-back guarantee; see our <a href="/refunds">Refund Policy</a>.</p>

        <p>No NativeApply password is required. To use your purchase in another browser or recover access,
          request a single-use login link at <a href="/login">Log in</a> using your purchase email.
          Links expire after 15 minutes. Keep login links private and contact support if you lose access to that email.
          You can log out of one browser, or of every device at once, from the same page.</p>
        <p>Do not disrupt the service or attempt to bypass security controls. Temporary safeguards may limit
          abusive traffic. Pro has no daily rewrite allowance. To protect availability, each Pro account can
          submit up to {PRO_BURST_LIMIT} rewrite requests per {PRO_BURST_SECONDS} seconds across its browsers and devices.
          Service interruptions can still occur.
          If you cannot use a paid service, contact us so we can restore access or address the payment.</p>
        <p>Our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> explains how text, access details, and usage data are processed.</p>
        <p>Copy, email, and WhatsApp tools help you move a result to another application. NativeApply does
          not send job applications or messages on your behalf. You choose the recipient and confirm sending
          in the other application. Its availability and terms depend on that provider. Long results may
          need to be copied and pasted instead of opened through a link.</p>
