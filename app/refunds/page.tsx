        <p>
          If you subscribe to Pro, your first payment is fully refundable for 14 days. Ask within 14 days of that charge and you get the
          whole amount back, no questions asked and no reason needed.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can cancel at any time; you keep access until the end of the billing period you already paid for,
          with no further renewals once cancellation is confirmed. The first-payment guarantee does not
          automatically apply to renewal payments. If a renewal charge looks wrong, request a review through
          <a href="https://paddle.net/contact"> Paddle payment help</a> within 14 days. You do not need to email NativeApply.
          This review window does not limit your statutory rights.

          <li>Open <a href="/subscription#cancel">Access &amp; billing</a> and enter the email used for your purchase.</li>
          <li>Open the secure link in your email to verify access. No NativeApply password or Paddle login is required.</li>
          <li>Select your subscription, choose Cancel subscription, and confirm. Check the confirmation and access end date.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Cancel before your next renewal. A confirmed cancellation stops future renewals; it does not refund
          an existing charge. If you want a refund as well, follow the instructions below. A refund may end the
          Pro access associated with the refunded payment.</p>
        <p>If you cannot access your email or the cancellation fails, contact <a href={`mailto:${SUPPORT_EMAIL}`}>{SUPPORT_EMAIL}</a>.
          You can also use the management link in your Paddle receipt or <a href="https://paddle.net">Paddle payment support</a>.
          Keep a copy of your request and contact us if confirmation does not arrive. A delay in our response
          does not remove rights you have under applicable law.</p>

          <li>Review the first payment shown, choose Request first-payment refund, and confirm the refund and cancellation of future renewals.</li>
          <li>We submit eligible requests directly to Paddle. Check the status on the same page. A request awaiting approval is not yet an approved refund.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>No support email or explanation is needed for an eligible first-payment request. Paddle may require
          its own approval. Approved refunds return to the original payment method; the time for the credit
          to appear depends on that provider. Access from the refunded payment ends.</p>
        <p>Your request date determines whether you meet our 14-day guarantee, even if processing takes longer.
          If the automated option is unavailable, a request is unconfirmed, or another charge needs review,
          use <a href="https://paddle.net/contact">Paddle payment help</a> directly. Keep your request confirmation.
          You do not need to email NativeApply. Never share a password or full card number.</p>
